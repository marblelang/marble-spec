Marble is a programming language that takes inspiration from C# and Kotlin.
It is a statically typed language that compiles to [Common Intermediate Language (CIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) bytecode. It is designed
to be a general purpose language that can be used with the [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET) ecosystem.

The goals of Marble are:

- Be a general purpose language that is simple, modern, and object-oriented.
- Support software engineering principles such as strong type checking, generics, and interfaces.
- Be a language that is easy to learn and use, especially for those who are familiar with C# and Java.
- Support functional programming principles such as first-class functions, lambdas, and pattern matching.
- Be a language that is easy to extend and embed.

Marble (IPA: /ˈmɑɹ.bəl/), in its name, is a reference to the [marble toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_(toy)).
